{"text": "SNH48 is a large Chinese youth girl group established in Shanghai, China in 2012. It is currently the largest youth girl group in the Chinese-speaking world and is affiliated with Shanghai Siba Culture Media Group Co., Ltd. SNH48's basic positioning is based on the concept of 'idols you can meet', featuring an internet-based approach and participatory spirit as a close-contact, developmental large-scale youth girl group."}
{"text": "In addition to the Shanghai headquarters, current sub-groups include BEJ48 centered in Beijing, GNZ48 centered in Guangzhou, CKG48 centered in Chongqing, and CGT48 centered in Chengdu.

{"text": "SNH48's early performances and EP and album releases were Chinese covers of AKB48 Group songs. On June 9, 2016, AKB48's management stated that SNH48 violated the contract and would reassess SNH48's management and remove all SNH48-related information and advertisements from the AKB48 official website. SNH48's management responded the next day, June 10, 2016, stating there was no violation and that the relationship was a technical cooperation. They also removed AKB48-related information from the SNH48 official website, effectively terminating the cooperative relationship."}
